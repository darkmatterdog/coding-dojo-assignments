# Coding Dojo: The Repository


**Hello world!** This is the repository for all the projects I'm working on during the Coding Dojo bootcamp.

It is organized by stack, and by day within each stack.

I am *rather new* to version control and programming in general. Expect less-than ideal practices and **broken code.**


*"I told them I worked in repo and they got entirely the wrong idea. I meant, like, GitHub, not taking peoples' stuff."* -confused programmer, 2022
