# Coding Dojo: The Repository

**Hello world!** This is the repository for all the projects I'm working on during the Coding Dojo bootcamp.

It is organized by stack, and by day within each stack.

I am *rather new* to version control. I am also a fairly inexperienced programmer. Expect less-than ideal practices.
